"""Fit staged audit-view images to the Claude Code delivery limit.

Claude Code downscales any image whose long edge exceeds 2000 px before the
model sees it. Doing that transform here instead makes the delivered pixels a
recorded property of the run rather than a host-side side effect.

This file is Claude-harness adaptation. It is ADDED alongside the ported Codex
bundle and never edits it: `figannot.py` and every `references/*.md` carried
over from `.codex/skills/figmirror` stay byte-identical to their source, as
recorded in MANIFEST.md.

Rules:
  - Only resize when the long edge exceeds the limit. A compliant image is left
    byte-identical; it is not re-encoded.
  - Always PNG in, PNG out. Never transcode to JPEG.
  - Resize in place, and only ever on a staged copy inside `audit_view_<N>/`.
    Everything else in the workdir is either an original or carries geometry
    that other steps depend on, so the check is on the containing directory,
    not on the filename. Filename matching cannot express this invariant:
    `reference_clean.png` exists both at `inputs/reference_clean.png` (the L1
    measurement anchor the Drawer measures against, must never be touched) and
    at `audit_view_<N>/reference_clean.png` (a staged copy, must be fitted).
    `composite.png` is then the one exception inside that directory:
    `figannot.py compose` records its native W/H/draft_x/draft_w in
    `composite_meta.json`, the Reviewer treats those as hard coordinate bounds,
    and `figannot.py draw` clamps and renders the returned boxes against the
    same native metadata. Resizing it without resizing the metadata puts every
    drawn box off-target while `draw` still exits 0.
  - Emit one JSON object per image so the applied factor can be recorded in
    `process.md` and used later to separate native-resolution reviews from
    heavily downscaled ones.

Usage:
    python fit_images.py --max-edge 2000 IMAGE [IMAGE ...]
    python fit_images.py --max-edge 2000 --report out.json IMAGE [IMAGE ...]

Missing paths are skipped and reported with `"status": "missing"`, because
`accepted_control.png` is present only on strict-3D iterations.
