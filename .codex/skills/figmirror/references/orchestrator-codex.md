# Codex Orchestrator Wiring

This reference is the Codex-only loop harness for `figmirror`.
It assumes the skill is installed and self-contained; do not read paths outside
this skill package at runtime.

Codex runtime shape: the top-level Codex process is Orchestrator only. It owns
staging, iteration state, role prompts, render verification, Reviewer audit-view
construction, subagent dispatch through `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent`, the next
action after each deterministic decision, selection, and finalization. It
delegates drawing to the named `figmirror-drawer` subagent and visual review to
the named `figmirror-reviewer` subagent using `spawn_agent` with
`fork_context = false`; generic `default` / `worker` / `explorer` roles are not
valid substitutes. Candidate-pool generation is an optional host-level mode and
is outside the default shipped loop.

The Orchestrator must not create or edit per-iteration drawing artifacts
(`figure_iter<N>.py`, `img_iter<N>.png`, `notes_iter<N>.md`, or
`floor_selfcheck_iter<N>.txt`) itself. Those files are Drawer-owned protocol
outputs. After spawning Drawer, wait long enough for real production work before
declaring the role unavailable: wait at least 20 minutes for iter 0 and at least
10 minutes for later iters. A wait timeout with no terminal agent state means the Drawer is still running;
continue waiting on that same child. Do not close or re-spawn a Drawer solely because a wait timed out.
Only a terminal child state with an incomplete four-file bundle may trigger a re-spawn of the same
`figmirror-drawer` role with a narrower repair task. Do not call `close_agent` on
a live Drawer to manufacture that terminal state; do not draw inline.

The Orchestrator must also not perform visual/style judgment itself, even as a
"sanity look" at `img_iter<N>.png` or `composite.png`. Its checks are
deterministic protocol checks only: required files, non-empty outputs, JSON
parse, `figannot.py` compose/draw success, and final-bundle existence. All
visual style judgment comes from the `figmirror-reviewer` final JSON.

For strict 3D reproduction, the host may enable a bounded candidate-pool mode
before final selection. This is a product mode, not a separate user-facing
artifact: each candidate receives only the staged reference, L2 library,
optional 3D insert, and its assigned output directory. Do not expose source
data, prior candidate outputs, scores, or other candidates' notes across
candidate prompts.

## Setup

Resolve paths at the start of a run:

```bash
WORKDIR=/absolute/path/to/run-directory
SKILL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/figmirror
REFERENCES=$SKILL_DIR/references
USE_3D_INSERT=${USE_3D_INSERT:-0}
USE_3D_CANDIDATE_SCORER=${USE_3D_CANDIDATE_SCORER:-0}
PYTHON_CMD=${FIGMIRROR_PYTHON_CMD:-"uv run python"}
```

Use `PYTHON_CMD` for every Python invocation in this workflow, including
`tools/figannot.py` help/compose/review-decision/draw, Drawer render checks, and final
bundle execution. Bare `python` / `python3` commands are not valid in this repo.
Do not run Python just to summarize `inputs/data.txt` when `data_echo.md` is
already present; read the staged summary and inspect `inputs/data.txt` directly
only for semantic details needed by the Drawer brief.

Stage the local run copy of the bundled references:

```bash
mkdir -p "$WORKDIR/inputs" "$WORKDIR/prompts" "$WORKDIR/tools"
cp "$REFERENCES/drawer.md" "$WORKDIR/prompts/drawer.md"
cp "$REFERENCES/preprocessor.md" "$WORKDIR/prompts/preprocessor.md"
cp "$REFERENCES/reviewer.md" "$WORKDIR/prompts/reviewer.md"
cp "$REFERENCES/orchestrator-codex.md" "$WORKDIR/prompts/orchestrator-codex.md"
cp "$REFERENCES/aesthetic-library.md" "$WORKDIR/prompts/aesthetic-library.md"
cp "$REFERENCES/aesthetic-library.md" "$WORKDIR/inputs/aesthetic-library.md"
cp "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/figannot.py" "$WORKDIR/tools/figannot.py"
```

Set `USE_3D_INSERT=1` only when the user asks for a 3D figure, the reference is
visibly 3D, or the parsed data requires 3D encoding. When enabled, stage the
conditional router, mode files, and 3D modules:

```bash
if [ "$USE_3D_INSERT" = "1" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$WORKDIR/prompts/three-d" "$WORKDIR/inputs/three-d"
  cp "$REFERENCES/three-d-prompting.md" "$WORKDIR/prompts/three-d-prompting.md"
  cp "$REFERENCES/three-d-prompting.md" "$WORKDIR/inputs/three-d-prompting.md"
  cp "$REFERENCES"/three-d/*.md "$WORKDIR/prompts/three-d/"
  cp "$REFERENCES"/three-d/*.md "$WORKDIR/inputs/three-d/"
fi
if [ "$USE_3D_CANDIDATE_SCORER" = "1" ]; then
  test "$USE_3D_INSERT" = "1"
  cp "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/score_3d_candidates.py" "$WORKDIR/tools/score_3d_candidates.py"
fi
```

The uploaded reference image must be preserved as
`$WORKDIR/inputs/reference_raw.png`. For first paint or older workdirs,
`$WORKDIR/inputs/reference_clean.png` may initially be a copy of the upload; Stage
0 overwrites it with the cleaned crop. The parsed or original data must be stored
as `$WORKDIR/inputs/data.txt`.

## Stage 0: Reference Preprocessing

Before data generation, Drawer, or Reviewer, run the reference preprocessor as a
separate bounded agent/process using `prompts/preprocessor.md`. It must read
`inputs/reference_raw.png`, crop away removable whitespace/captions/page text or
neighboring panels, compare the before/after crop, and write:

- `inputs/reference_clean.png`
- `inputs/reference_crop_check.png`
- `inputs/reference_crop_report.md`

If the crop would remove figure information, retry with a larger box. If no safe
crop exists, preserve the raw image as `reference_clean.png` and record `no safe
crop` in the report.

## Per-Iteration Loop

Use the `max_iters` and `min_reviews` values provided by the caller/runner. If
no values are provided, default to `max_iters = 5` Drawer rounds and
`min_reviews = 2` valid Reviewer calls in total across all drafts. `N` counts
Drawer rounds only; repeated review of one immutable draft does not advance
`N`.
Iterate Drawer rounds as `N = 0..max_iters-1`.
`max_iters` is a hard Drawer cap. No auto mode, prompt instruction, or runtime
flag may create Drawer round `max_iters` or later:

1. Orchestrator spawns `agent_type = "figmirror-drawer"` with
   `fork_context = false`. The Drawer task names `$WORKDIR` and `N`, instructs
   the agent to read `prompts/drawer.md`, `prompts/aesthetic-library.md`,
   optional `prompts/three-d-prompting.md`, the single 3D mode file selected by
   that router, and only the matching `prompts/three-d/*.md` modules; optional
   `tools/score_3d_candidates.py` when quantitative 3D candidate diagnosis is
   enabled, `inputs/reference_clean.png`, `inputs/reference_crop_report.md` if
   present, `inputs/data.txt`, prior notes, prior audit, and prior annotated
   feedback (`review_feedback_<N-1>/annotated.png` plus
   `review_feedback_<N-1>/notes.md`) if `N > 0`.
2. Drawer writes `figure_iter<N>.py`, `img_iter<N>.png`, `notes_iter<N>.md`,
   and `floor_selfcheck_iter<N>.txt` in `$WORKDIR`. It must not launch `codex`,
   `claude`, or another model process.
   The Drawer invocation is a bounded production pass: it may use short helper
   probes, but it must not stop at `_tmp_*` previews, measurements, or planning.
   Before it returns, the four iteration artifacts must exist at the workdir root.
3. Orchestrator verifies the four iter artifacts are non-empty before any
   Reviewer handoff. If anything is missing before the patience window has
   elapsed, keep waiting on the same Drawer. Use `wait_agent` timeouts of at
   least 20 minutes for iter 0 and 10 minutes for later iters. A wait timeout
   without a terminal state keeps ownership with the same live child: wait on
   it again, even when no output exists yet. Re-spawn the same Drawer role with
   a sharper repair task only after that child reaches a terminal state and the
   bundle is still incomplete. Prove that condition by running
   `/absolute/path/to/run-directory/tools/figannot.py check-drawer-bundle
   --workdir /absolute/path/to/run-directory --iter N` after the terminal wait
   and before any replacement spawn. Substitute the actual absolute paths in
   this trace-critical command; do not pass `$WORKDIR`, `$FIGANNOT`, or relative path tokens.
   A nonzero result naming at least one missing bundle file is the
   only authorization for one narrower same-iteration replacement; do not draw
   inline as Orchestrator.
4. Orchestrator stages `audit_view_<N>`, builds `composite.png` with
   `tools/figannot.py compose`, and spawns `agent_type = "figmirror-reviewer"`
   with `fork_context = false`. Send the complete Reviewer task and visual
   bundle in one structured `items` payload, with one text item followed by the
   composite, reference, and draft local-image items exactly once. The Reviewer
   sees only the audit view, does not reopen image paths, and returns strict JSON
   as its final message.
5. Orchestrator saves the Reviewer final JSON to a temporary incoming file
   outside the audit view. The incoming filename must contain the exact Reviewer session ID,
   for example `.review_incoming_<reviewer-session-id>.json`. It MUST NOT interpret
   the fields or write a canonical audit itself. Run `tools/figannot.py review-decision` with the incoming JSON,
   `$WORKDIR`, `N`, `img_iter<N>.png`, the fresh Reviewer child session ID, and
   `min_reviews`, and `max_iters`. The helper performs file validation and the
   atomic decision-state transition only: it never launches a subagent or
   chooses an unreturned next action. For a valid result it records the attempt
   and returns exactly one action for the top-level Orchestrator to follow.
   Missing, malformed, non-object, or internally inconsistent Reviewer output is
   recorded as an invalid terminal attempt and does not count. The first such
   result returns `retry_reviewer`; a second consecutive invalid result is
   persisted and exits nonzero.
   The valid actions are:
   - `retry_reviewer`: the result is invalid and does not count. Retry this
     review slot once with a fresh Reviewer on the same immutable draft. Do not
     run Drawer or expose the invalid payload to the replacement Reviewer. A
     second consecutive invalid result fails closed.
   - `review_same_draft`: the result is a clean `ship`, but fewer than
     `min_reviews` valid Reviewer calls have completed across the run. Spawn a
     new Reviewer on the same audit view and byte-identical
     `img_iter<N>.png`. Do not spawn Drawer, do not advance `N`, and do not
     expose the first review JSON to the new Reviewer.
   - `draw`: actionable feedback exists. The helper has written the canonical
     `review_feedback_<N>/review.json` and `audit_iter<N>.json`; run
     `tools/figannot.py draw --max-iters <max_iters>`, then start Drawer round
     `N+1` only if the helper succeeds. The helper returns
     this action only when `N+1 < max_iters`.
     The next valid review must name `N+1` and its canonical draft hash must
     differ from `img_iter<N>.png`; reviewing the old draft again is invalid.
   - `ship`: the clean `ship` meets `min_reviews`. The helper has written the
     canonical audit; select this iteration and finalize without another Drawer.
   - `stop_at_cap`: actionable feedback exists but the current draft is
     `N = max_iters-1` (the fifth draft under the default). Do not run `draw` and
     do not spawn Drawer. Enter the hard-cap finalization policy below.
6. Only the helper's `draw` action may start another Drawer. Never ask Drawer to
   act on an empty repair brief, an invalid review, or a clean provisional ship.
7. `min_reviews` counts every valid Reviewer call across drafts, whether clean or
   actionable. Invalid results do not count. A clean result before the total
   reaches `min_reviews` reviews the same byte-identical draft again without a
   Drawer call. Actionable feedback starts another Drawer whenever the hard cap
   has not been reached; it does not reset the valid-review count.

The Drawer cap does not prevent additional review calls on the final draft. A
clean result below `min_reviews` still returns `review_same_draft`, and a later
clean result may return `ship`; only another Drawer is prohibited at the cap.

At the hard cap, select the best floor-passing `close` iteration with the
lowest reference drift; otherwise select any floor-passing iteration with the
shortest violation list.

## 3D Meta Review Gate

When the 3D insert is staged, the Orchestrator acts as the process-level Meta
Reviewer. It does not replace the named visual Reviewer; it checks whether the
Drawer/Reviewer loop is coherent before accepting a repair, selecting a final
render, or declaring `ship`.

For strict 3D reproduction, reject the iteration as meta-invalid and continue or
rerender a narrower repair when any of these process checks fail:

- Reviewer JSON is invalid or lacks `three_d_scorecard`.
- Strict 3D scorecard uses non-canonical field names instead of
  `camera_box_aspect` and `text_export_floor`.
- Reviewer focus does not address the lowest one or two primary 3D dimensions
  before polish.
- Drawer ignores those dimensions without a compact conflict ledger grounded in
  L1/L2 evidence.
- `N > 0` strict repair lacks a rendered accepted-control comparison or changes
  multiple primary registers without separate probes.
- A repair improves color, detail, labels, or cleanliness while regressing
  topology, projected footprint, camera/box aspect, composition/occupancy, or
  export floor.
- A topology or footprint repair changes camera, box aspect, final-export crop,
  subject occupancy, mark overlays, palette semantics, or export floor without a
  separate accepted registration probe.
- A later render is selected merely because it is later.
- `ship` is claimed below the score thresholds, with an active hard gate, or
  with an export-floor failure.

Before adding any new 3D rule to a run-local repair brief, apply a
generalization gate: the rule must be triggered by visible L1 evidence, apply
beyond one example or be explicitly scoped to a visible 3D class, avoid numeric
or construction checkboxes that can be satisfied mechanically, and avoid case
names, paths, prior scores, or run provenance.

## Drawer Execution

Spawn the Drawer as a named subagent:

```text
agent_type = "figmirror-drawer"
fork_context = false
Role: figmirror-drawer
Iter: $ITER
```

The Drawer prompt must be self-contained and name the working directory, iter
index, staged prompt paths, input paths, prior audit path when present, and the
four required output files. It must also name the local render command from
`PYTHON_CMD`; the Drawer must use that command instead of guessing `python` or
`python3`.
Put the exact lines `Role: figmirror-drawer` and `Iter: $ITER` near the top of
the prompt, replacing `$ITER` with the current non-negative decimal iteration,
so the transport trace can be deterministically audited.
State that the task is a bounded production pass: temporary probes are allowed
only as local aids, and the Drawer must write `figure_iter<N>.py`,
`img_iter<N>.png`, `notes_iter<N>.md`, and `floor_selfcheck_iter<N>.txt` before
returning.

For `N = 0`, perform the Drawer prompt's anchor-measurement pass before writing
the first figure. For `N > 0`, copy `figure_iter<N-1>.py` to
`figure_iter<N>.py` and edit incrementally. For strict 3D, source that copy from
the current accepted iteration when it differs from `N-1`. Respect
`audit_iter<N-1>.json.anchor.what_is_right` as a preserve list, address
`quality_floor.violation_kinds` before fidelity themes, and explain any conflict
between Reviewer feedback and measured anchors in `notes_iter<N>.md`. If there
is a real conflict, the notes must include a compact `## Conflict ledger` section
so the next Reviewer can spend extra effort on that property.

For `N > 0`, the Drawer prompt must also name the prior annotated feedback:
`review_feedback_<N-1>/annotated.png` and
`review_feedback_<N-1>/notes.md`. The annotated
image is the far-view reference|draft composite with numbered boxes on the
draft side; `notes.md` maps each number to the actionable mismatch. The Drawer
should fix those boxed spots first, then preserve any prior
`anchor.what_is_right` entries unless L1/L2 evidence proves a correction.

For strict 3D repairs with `N > 0`, keep a rendered accepted-control candidate
under final export settings and compare it against each probe before Reviewer
handoff. If every probe regresses topology, footprint, camera/aspect,
composition/occupancy, or export floor, export the accepted control as the
iteration result and mark the repair unresolved in notes.

Before launching the Reviewer, verify that `figure_iter<N>.py`,
`img_iter<N>.png`, `notes_iter<N>.md`, and `floor_selfcheck_iter<N>.txt` exist
and are non-empty. Missing artifacts before the patience window are not evidence
that Drawer is dead. Wait at least 20 minutes for iter 0 and 10 minutes for
later iters. A timed-out wait without a terminal child state continues on the
same child. Repair missing artifacts by re-spawning `figmirror-drawer` with the
same role and a narrower repair instruction only after the child is terminal.
Do not close a live Drawer to manufacture that state. Run the incomplete-bundle
check with the actual absolute script and workdir paths, not shell variables or
relative path tokens.

## Reviewer Invocation

```bash
ITER=<N>
FIGANNOT="$WORKDIR/tools/figannot.py"
AV="$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER"
test ! -e "$AV"
mkdir "$AV"
cp "$WORKDIR/inputs/reference_clean.png" "$AV/reference_clean.png"
cp "$WORKDIR/img_iter$ITER.png" "$AV/draft_fullres.png"
cp "$REFERENCES/reviewer.md" "$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER/reviewer.md"
cp "$REFERENCES/aesthetic-library.md" "$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER/aesthetic-library.md"
if [ -f "$WORKDIR/prompts/three-d-prompting.md" ]; then
  cp "$WORKDIR/prompts/three-d-prompting.md" "$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER/three-d-prompting.md"
  if [ -d "$WORKDIR/prompts/three-d" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER/three-d"
    cp "$WORKDIR"/prompts/three-d/*.md "$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER/three-d/"
  fi
  if [ "$ITER" -gt 0 ] && [ -n "${ACCEPTED_ITER:-}" ]; then
    cp "$WORKDIR/img_iter$ACCEPTED_ITER.png" "$WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER/accepted_control.png"
  fi
fi
bash -lc "$PYTHON_CMD \"$FIGANNOT\" compose \
  --ref \"$WORKDIR/inputs/reference_clean.png\" \
  --draft \"$WORKDIR/img_iter$ITER.png\" \
  --reviewer-md \"$REFERENCES/reviewer.md\" \
  --out-dir \"$AV\""
```

Then spawn the Reviewer:

```text
agent_type = "figmirror-reviewer"
fork_context = false
```

Reviewer task text:

```text
Role: figmirror-reviewer
Audit view: $WORKDIR/audit_view_$ITER
Iter: $ITER
Read review_prompt.txt, reviewer.md, and aesthetic-library.md from the audit
view. Far view: composite.png. Near views: reference_clean.png and
draft_fullres.png. Optional fixed 3D audit material: three-d-prompting.md plus
routed files under three-d/. This is a closed, stateless audit of the current
draft: do not read process state, Drawer notes, review history, or history-like
files. Use the L1/L2/L3 hierarchy: ground every claim in L1 or L2, never L3.
For geometry, use composite bbox coordinates, visual estimates, and any
diagnostics already staged in the audit view; separate global canvas shape, per-panel shape, and inter-panel gutter/packing.
Do not read outside this audit view. Do not write
files. Do not run code or Python. Return the JSON object specified in reviewer.md
and nothing else.

The visual inputs are already attached once in this order: composite.png,
reference_clean.png, draft_fullres.png, followed by accepted_control.png only
when that optional strict-3D file is present. Do not call `view_image` or reopen
image paths. If a final checkpoint asks you to recheck the figure, reconsider
the already attached pixels without performing another image/tool pass.
```

Use one structured `items` payload for the spawn. Do not set `message`, and do
not convert the local images into text-only path markers:

```json
{
  "agent_type": "figmirror-reviewer",
  "fork_context": false,
  "items": [
    {"type": "text", "text": "<the complete Reviewer task text above>"},
    {"type": "local_image", "path": "$AV/composite.png"},
    {"type": "local_image", "path": "$AV/reference_clean.png"},
    {"type": "local_image", "path": "$AV/draft_fullres.png"}
  ]
}
```

If `$AV/accepted_control.png` exists, append exactly one additional
`local_image` item for it after `draft_fullres.png`. Do not attach
`img_iter$ITER.png` as well: it is byte-identical to the staged
`draft_fullres.png` and would duplicate the near view.

The Orchestrator treats the Reviewer final text as the only audit payload. Save
that exact text with `apply_patch` to a temporary file outside the audit view;
do not interpolate it through shell quoting, and keep that file until the
adapter finishes post-run verification. The incoming filename must contain the exact Reviewer session ID.
For example, use `.review_incoming_<reviewer-session-id>.json`. If the final is missing or empty,
create an empty incoming file. `review-decision` records malformed, empty, and
non-object values as invalid attempts without fabricating a visual verdict.

For this command only, materialize the script path and every flag value as literals
in the command text recorded by the trace. Expand `PYTHON_CMD`, the absolute
workdir, the decimal iteration, the canonical draft path, the exact child ID,
`min_reviews`, and `max_iters` before execution. Do not leave `$WORKDIR`, `$ITER`, or another
shell variable in the traced command. Replace the sample values below with the
current run's literal values, then run the deterministic gate:

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=/datadrive/xiaohan/figmirror/uv-cache uv run --project /absolute/path/to/repo python /absolute/path/to/run-directory/tools/figannot.py review-decision \
  --review /absolute/path/to/run-directory/.review_incoming_<reviewer-child-id>.json \
  --workdir /absolute/path/to/run-directory \
  --iter 0 \
  --draft /absolute/path/to/run-directory/img_iter0.png \
  --reviewer-session <reviewer-child-id> \
  --min-reviews 2 \
  --max-iters 5
```

Obey the returned `action` literally:

- `review_same_draft`: spawn a new `figmirror-reviewer` with the same `$AV`
  and the same attached image paths. Do not run `draw`, do not spawn Drawer,
  and do not change `ITER`. The helper intentionally has not written the first
  clean result into the audit view, so the next Reviewer sees the same closed
  current-draft input without another review's result.
- `retry_reviewer`: retry the same review slot once with a fresh
  `figmirror-reviewer`, the same `$AV`, and the same attached image paths. It
  does not count toward `min_reviews` and must never trigger Drawer. A second
  consecutive invalid result is persisted as retry exhaustion and exits
  nonzero.
- `draw`: run the command below. Apply the same trace-literal rule to this draw
  command: materialize the Python command, script path, and `--out-dir` as
  literal values in the recorded command; do not leave `$PYTHON_CMD`,
  `$WORKDIR`, `$ITER`, or another shell variable. The helper has already written
  the canonical audit and `review_feedback_<N>/review.json`; `annotated.png`
  plus `notes.md` in that feedback directory become the next Drawer's repair brief.
  The next Reviewer runs only after Drawer writes the changed `img_iter<N+1>.png`.
- `ship`: select this iter and finalize. Do not run `draw` or spawn Drawer.
- `stop_at_cap`: do not run `draw` and do not spawn Drawer. Apply the hard-cap
  selection policy and finalize the selected existing iteration.

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=/datadrive/xiaohan/figmirror/uv-cache uv run --project /absolute/path/to/repo python /absolute/path/to/run-directory/tools/figannot.py draw --out-dir /absolute/path/to/run-directory/review_feedback_0 --max-iters 5
```

The Reviewer restriction is prompt-level: it must not write files. Treat any
Reviewer-side write as a protocol anomaly and record it in `process.md`.

**Reviewer failure handling — MANDATORY, never fabricate an audit.** If the
Reviewer subagent fails, stalls/times out, does not return valid JSON, or
`review-decision` returns `retry_reviewer`, you MUST NOT invent
`quality_floor` / `fidelity` verdicts. A fabricated `passed:true` /
`verdict:close` audit silently disables the ONLY quality gate and ships broken
drafts. Instead:

1. Retry the same `figmirror-reviewer` role once with the same audit view, a new
   child session ID, and a fresh single structured image bundle. Keep the same
   no-`view_image`, no-reopen rule. Do not expose the invalid result.
2. If it fails again, let `review-decision` persist the exhausted invalid
   attempt and exit nonzero. Write the reason to `REVIEWER_FAILED`, record it in
   `process.md`, stop the sample nonzero, and do not finalize or select any
   iteration.

Do not synthesize a `reviewer_unavailable` audit: it would have no valid Reviewer
terminal payload or matching ledger transition. A fabricated audit of any
verdict is a protocol violation.

## Finalization

Copy the selected iteration to final artifacts:

```bash
cp "$WORKDIR/figure_iter$SELECTED.py" "$WORKDIR/figure.py"
(cd "$WORKDIR" && bash -lc "$PYTHON_CMD figure.py")
```

Before the final run, ensure `figure.py` saves `figure.png`, `figure.pdf`, and
`output.png`; `output.png` is the evaluator-facing PNG and may be an identical
copy of `figure.png`. The final run must also write
`floor_selfcheck_final.txt`. Write `selection.md` with the selected iteration and
reason, `process.md` with a concise iteration changelog, and `status.json` with
machine-readable finalization status. If any final-bundle file is missing after
the run, repair `figure.py` or finalization and rerun it before exiting.
